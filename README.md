# Simple script to convert markdown files in a folder to html in another folder

! The script **uses subprocess** to run pandoc.

**Don't forget** to change those constants according to your needs:

```
PANDOC_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/pandoc"
MARKDOWN_FOLDER = "MARKDOWN FOLDER"
HTML_OUTPUT = "HTML FOLDER"
```
